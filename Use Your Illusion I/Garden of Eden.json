    "lyrics": "It\u2019s a critical solution, and the east coast got the blues\nIt\u2019s a mass of confusion, like the lies they sell to you\nYou got a glass-jawed toothache of a mental disease\nAnd they be running \u2019round back, see them line up on their knees\n\u2019Cause the kiss-ass sycophants, throwing penance at your feet\nWhen they got nowhere to go Watch them come in off the streets\nWhile they\u2019re banging out front Inside they\u2019re slamming to the crunch\nGo on an throw me to the lions\n\u2019Cause the pissed-off rip-offs, they\u2019re everywhere you turn\nTell me how a generation\u2019s ever supposed to learn\nThis fire is burning, and it\u2019s out of control\nIt\u2019s not a problem you can stop It\u2019s rock n\u2019 roll\nI read it on a wall, it went straight to my head\nIt said, \"Dance to the tension of a world on edge\"\nWe got racial violence, and who\u2019ll cast the first stone?\nAnd sex is used any way it can be\nSometimes, when I look out, it\u2019s hard to see the day\nIt\u2019s a feeling, you can have it, it\u2019s not mine to take away\nSaid, we\u2019re lost in the Garden of Eden\nAnd there\u2019s no one who\u2019s gonna believe this\nBut we\u2019re lost in the Garden of Eden\nThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna fit in\nDon\u2019t you tell me who to believe in\nI ain\u2019t superstitious, but I know when something\u2019s wrong\nI\u2019ve been dragging my heels with a bitch called hope\nLet the undercurrent drag me along\nBut we\u2019re lost in the Garden of Eden, come on\nMost organized religions make a mockery of humanity\nOur governments are dangerous and out of control\nThe Garden of Eden is just another graveyard\nSaid, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d sell my soul",
