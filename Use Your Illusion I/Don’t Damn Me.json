        "So I send this song to the offended\nI said what I meant and I\u2019ve never pretended\nAs so many others do intending just to please\nIf I damned your point of view\nCould you turn the other cheek",
        "Don\u2019t damn me\nI said don\u2019t damn me\nI said don\u2019t hail me\nAh, don\u2019t damn me\nSmoke \u2019em if you got \u2019em\nAlright, that sucked"
