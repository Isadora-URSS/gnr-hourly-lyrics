Don\u2019t fuck with me\n\u2019Cause I\u2019m what you\u2019ll be, so don\u2019t fuck with me\nIf you had better sense You\u2019d step aside from the bad side of me\nDon\u2019t fuck wit da bad side o\u2019 me\nStay way from the bad side o\u2019 me\nOstracized but that\u2019s all right\nI was thinkin\u2019 about somethin\u2019 myself\nCall on everybody who\u2019s got last rites\nSaid it\u2019s better If you locked \u2019em away\nRunnin\u2019 through the visions At the speed of light\nMother fucker just let me be\nGod dammit better let me be",
