    "lyrics": "When you\u2019re talkin\u2019 to yourself And nobody\u2019s home\nYou can fool yourself\nYou came in this world alone (Alone)\nSo nobody ever told you baby How it was gonna be\nGuess we\u2019ll have to wait and see\nOld at heart but I\u2019m only twenty eight\nAnd I\u2019m much too young To let love break my heart\nYoung at heart but it\u2019s getting much too late\nI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re s\u2019posed to find me lately\nHow could you say that I never needed you\nSaid you took everything from me\nYoung at heart an it gets so hard to wait\nWhen no one I know can seem to help me now\nOld at heart but I musn\u2019t hesitate\nStill talkin\u2019 to myself And nobody\u2019s home (Alone)\nSo nobody ever told us baby How it was gonna be\nWhen I find out all the reasons\nMaybe I\u2019ll find another way\nWith all the changing seasons of my life\nMaybe I\u2019ll get it right next time\nGot your head out of the clouds\nYou\u2019re back down on the ground\nAnd you don\u2019t talk so loud\nAn you don\u2019t walk so proud\nWell I jumped into the river\nI\u2019m out here on my own, an drifting all alone\nIf it doesn\u2019t show give it time\n\u2019Cause I see the storm getting closer\nAnd the waves they get so high\nSeems everything we\u2019ve ever known\u2019s here\nWhy must it drift away and die\nI\u2019ll never find anyone to replace you\nGuess I\u2019ll have to make it through, this time - oh this time\nI knew the storm was getting closer\nAnd all my friends said I was high\nI never wanted it to die\n",
