    "lyrics": "Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness\nYeah I\u2019ll find a way to cure the pain\nI opened up the doors when it was cold outside\nBut how can I protect you\nI bought me an illusion An I put it on the wall\nI let it fill my head with dreams\nBut oh the taste is never so sweet As what you\u2019d believe it is\nYou know I never thought That it could take so long\nYou know I never knew how to be strong\nYeah, I let you shape me\nBut it feels as though you raped me\n\u2019Cause you climbed inside my world\nSo now I\u2019ve closed the door To keep the cold outside\nSeems somehow I\u2019ve found the will to live\nWhen we both know it takes time to forgive\nSweetness is a virtue\nAnd you lost your virtue long ago\nYou know I\u2019d like to hurt you\nBut my conscience always tells me no\n\u2019Cause my baby\u2019s got a locomotive\nMy baby\u2019s gone off the track\nMy baby\u2019s got a locomotive\nGot ta peel the bitch off my back\nI know it looks like I\u2019m insane\nTake a closer look I\u2019m not to blame\nGonna have some fun with my frustrations\nGonna watch the big screen in my head\nYour train of thought has cut me off again\nBetter tame that boy \u2019cause he\u2019s a wild one\nBetter tame that boy for he\u2019s a man\nSweetheart don\u2019t make me laugh\nYou\u2019s gettin\u2019 too big for your pants\nAnd I\u2019s think maybe you should Cut out while you can\nYou can use your illusion - Let it take you where it may\nWe live and learn\nAnd then sometimes it\u2019s best to walk away\nMe I\u2019m just here hangin\u2019 on\nIt\u2019s my only place to stay at least For now anyway\nI\u2019ve worked too hard for my illusions\nI\u2019m taking time quiet consolation\nIn passing by this love that\u2019s passed away\nI know it\u2019s never easy\nSo why should you believe me\nCalling off the dogs a simple choice is made\n\u2019Cause playful hearts Can sometimes be enraged\nYou know I tried to wake you\nI mean how long could it take you To open up your eyes and turn the page\nKindness is a treasure\nYa know I\u2019d like to shave your head\n\u2019Cause love to me\u2019s a two way street\nAn all I really want is peace\nAffection is a blessing\nI tried to keep this thing ta-gether\nBut the tremor tore my pad apart\nYeah I know it\u2019s hard to face\nWhen all we\u2019ve worked for\u2019s gone to waste\nBut you\u2019re such a stupid woman\nAnd I\u2019m such a stupid man\nBut love like time\u2019s got its own plans\nIf love is blind I guess I\u2019ll buy myself a cane\nLove\u2019s so strange\n",
