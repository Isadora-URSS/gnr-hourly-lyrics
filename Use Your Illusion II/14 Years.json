    "lyrics": "I try and feel the sunshine You bring the rain\nYou try and hold me down With your complaints\nYou cry and moan and complain\nYou just don\u2019t step inside to 14 years\nSo hard to keep my own head, that\u2019s what I say\nBut it\u2019s been 14 years of silence\nIt\u2019s been 14 years of pain\nIt\u2019s been 14 years that are gone forever\nYour stupid girlfriends tell you That I\u2019m to blame\nWell they\u2019re all used-up has-beens Out of the game\nThis time I\u2019ll have the last word\nHear what I say\nI tried to see it your way\nIt won\u2019t work today\nYou know, I\u2019ve been the dealer Hangin\u2019 on your street\nI was the dog, they all tried to beat\nLet\u2019s get naughtier!\nBullshit and contemplation Gossip\u2019s their trade\nIf they knew half the real truth What would they say\nWell I\u2019m past the point of concern\nIt\u2019s time to play\nThese last 4 years of madness Sure put me straight\nDon\u2019t get back 14 years In just one day\nSo hard to keep my own head\nJust go away\nYou know, just like a hooker, she said Nothing\u2019s for free\nOh I tried to see it your way",
