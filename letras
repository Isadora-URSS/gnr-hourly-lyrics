----Appetite for Destruction

--Welcome to the Jungle

Welcome to the jungle, we’ve got fun and games
We got everything you want honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Mwah, I, I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it you’re gonna bleed but it’s the price to pay
And you’re a very sexy girl who’s very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights but you won’t get there for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Ooh, ah, I want to hear you scream
Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here every day
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see you’ll take it eventually
You can have anything you want but you better not take it from me
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-knees, knees
Mwah, I’m gonna watch you bleed
And when you’re high, you never ever wanna come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah
You know where you are?
You’re in the jungle, baby, you’re gonna die
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my my, serpentine
Jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-knees, knees
Down In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to you
It’s gonna bring you down, huh

--It’s so Easy

I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She’s out to please
She pouts her best
She’s out to take
No need to try
She’s ready to make
It’s so easy, easy
When everybody’s tryin’ to please me baby
It’s so easy, easy
When everybody’s tryin’ to please me
Cars are crashin’ every night
I drink n’ drive everything’s in sight
I make the fire
But I miss the firefight
I hit the bull’s eye every night
It’s so easy, easy
When everybody’s tryin’ to please me baby
Yeah it’s so easy, easy
When everybody’s tryin’ to please me
So easy
But nothin’ seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you
You fall down
I see standin’ there
You think you’re so cool
Why don’t you just
Fuck off
Ya get nothin’ for nothin’
If that’s what ya do
Turn around bitch I got a use for you
Besides you ain’t got nothin’ better to do
And I’m bored
It’s so easy, easy
When everybody’s tryin’ to please me baby
It’s so easy, easy
When everybody’s tryin’ to please me
So easy
But nothin’ seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
So come with me
Don’t ask me where ’cause I don’t know
I’ll try ta please you
I ain’t got no money but it goes to show
It’s so easy
So fucking easy
It’s so easy
So damn easy
It’s so easy
So fucking easy
It’s so easy
Oh, it’s so easy
It’s so easy
So fucking easy
It’s so easy

--Nightrain

Loaded like a freight train
Flyin’ like an aeroplane
Feelin’ like a space brain
One more time tonight (look out)
Well, I’m a west coast struttin’
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase under my arm
Said I’m a mean machine
Been drinkin’ gasoline
And honey you can make my motor hum
I got one chance left
In a nine live cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a molotov cocktail with a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
And I can tell you honey
You can make my money tonight
Wake up late, honey put on your clothes
And take your credit card to the liquor store
Well that’s one for you and two for me by tonight
I’ll be loaded like a freight train
Flyin’ like an aeroplane
Feelin’ like a space brain
One more time tonight
I’m on the night train, bottoms up
I’m on the night train, fill my cup
I’m on the night train, ready to crash and burn
I never learn
I’m on the night train, I love that stuff
I’m on the night train, and I can never get enough
I’m on the night train, never to return, no
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin’ like an aeroplane
Speedin’ like a space brain
One more time tonight
I’m on the night train
And I’m lookin’ for some
I’m on the night train
So’s I can leave this slum
I’m on the night train
And I’m ready to crash and burn
Night train, bottoms up
I’m on the night train, fill my cup
I’m on the night train
Oh oh oh ohh oh yeah
I’m on the night train
Love that stuff
Ooh I’m on the night train
And I can never get enough
Ridin’ the night train
I guess I
I guess, I guess, I guess
I never learn
On the night train
Float me home
Ooh, I’m on the night train
Ridin’ the night train
Never to return
Night train

--Out Ta Get Me

Been hidin’ out
And layin’ low
It’s nothing new ta me
Well you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity
They break down the doors
And they rape my rights but
They won’t touch me
They scream and yell
And fight all night
You can’t tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
They won’t touch me
’Cause I got somethin’
I been buildin’ up inside
For so fuckin’ long
They’re out ta get me
They won’t catch me
I’m fucking innocent
They won’t break me
Sometimes it’s easy to forget where you’re goin’
Sometimes it’s harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you’re doin’
That’s when your troubles exceed
They push me in a corner
Just to get me to fight but
They won’t touch me
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can’t tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
They won’t touch me
’Cause I got somethin’ I been buildin’ up inside
I’m already gone!
They’re out ta get me
They won’t catch me
I’m innocent
They won’t break me
Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn’t buy that a fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I’d be quick to disagree
They’re out to get me
They won’t catch me
I’m fucking innocent
They won’t break me
They’re out to get me
They won’t catch me
’Cause I’m innocent
So, you can suck me
Take that one to heart

--Mr. Brownstone

I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don’t worry about nothin’ no
’Cause worryin’s a waste of my, time
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage at nine
Get on the bus at eleven
Sippin’ a drink and feelin’ fine
We been dancin’ with
Mr. Brownstone
He’s been knockin’
He won’t’ leave me alone
No, no, no
He won’t leave me alone
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn’t do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin’ ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn’t do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin’ ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
We been dancin’ with
Mr. Brownstone
He’s been knockin’
He won’t leave me alone
No, no, no
He won’t leave me alone
Now I get up around whenever
I used ta get up on time
But that old man he’s a real muthafucker
Gonna kick him on down the line
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn’t do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin’ ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn’t do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin’ ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
We been dancin’ with
Mr. Brownstone
He’s been knockin’
He won’t leave me alone
No, no no
He won’t leave me alone
Oh leave me alone
Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I should’ve known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I leave it all behind
Yowsa!

--Paradise City

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (oh, won’t you please take me home)
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (oh, won’t you please take me home)
Just a urchin livin’ under the street
I’m a hard case that’s tough to beat
I’m your charity case so buy me something to eat
I’ll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line
Rags to riches or so they say
Ya gotta keep pushin’ for the fortune and fame
You know it’s all a gamble when it’s just a game
Ya treat it like a capital crime
Everybody’s doin’ the time
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won’t you please take me home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Strapped in the chair of the city’s gas chamber
Why I’m here I can’t quite remember
The surgeon general says it’s hazardous to breathe
I’d have another cigarette but I can’t see
Tell me who you’re gonna believe
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won’t you please take me home, yeah yeah
So far away
So far away

Captain America’s been torn apart
Now he’s a court jester with a broken heart
He said "turn me around and take me back to the start"
I must be losing my mind "are you blind?"
I’ve seen it all a million times
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won’t you please take me home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won’t you please take me home
I wanna go, I wanna go
Oh, won’t you please take me home
I wanna see how good it can be
Oh, won’t you please take me home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won’t you please take me home
Take me down, lead me ’round
Oh, won’t you please take me home
I wanna see, what a woman can be
I want to take you home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won’t you please take me home
I wanna go, I wanna know
Oh, won’t you please take me home, yeah baby

--My Michelle

Your daddy works in porno
Now that mommy’s not around
She used to love her heroin
But now she’s underground
So you stay out late at night
And you do your dope for free
Drivin’ your friends crazy
With your life’s insanity
Well, well, well you just can’t tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Sowin’ all your wild oats
In another’s luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
Maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early
And this hotel wasn’t free
So party till your connection call
Honey I’ll return the key
Well, well, well you just can’t tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Well, well, well you never can tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Everyone needs love
You know that it’s true
Someday you’ll find someone
That’ll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When you’re all alone
Someday you’ll find someone
That you can call your own but till then ya better
Now you’re clean and so discreet
I won’t say a word
But most of all this song is true
Case you haven’t heard
So c’mon and stop your cryin’
’Cause we both know money burns
Honey don’t stop tryin’ and you’ll get what you deserve
Well, well, well you just can’t tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
Well, well, well you never can tell
Well, well, well my Michelle
My my my Michele
My my my Michele
My my my Michele
My my my Michele

--Sweet child o’ Mine

She’s got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long, I’d probably break down and cry
Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o’ mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She’s got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I’d hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I’d hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o’ mine
Whoa whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o’ mine
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Sweet love of mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o’ mine
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, sweet love of mine
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now?
Where do we go? (Sweet child)
Where do we go now?
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Where do we go now?
Ah, ah
Where do we go?
Oh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Oh, where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Oh, where do we go now?
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now

Always hungry for somethin’
That I haven’t had yet
Well maybe baby, you got somethin’ to lose
Well I got somethin’
I got somethin’ for you
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes
Panties round your knees
With your ass in debris
Doing that grind
With a push and a squeeze
Tied up, tied down
Up against the wall
Be my rubbermade baby
And we can do it all
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight

--Rocket Queen

If I say I don’t need anyone
I can say these things to you
’Cause I can turn on anyone
Just like I’ve turned on you

I’ve got a tongue like a razor
A sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors
But then you’ll do whatever I like

Here I am
And you’re a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey, I ain’t naive

Here I am
And you’re a Rocket Queen, oh, yeah
I might be too much
But honey, you’re a bit obscene

I’ve seen everything imaginable
Pass before these eyes
I’ve had everything that’s tangible
Honey, you’d be surprised

I’m a sexual innuendo
In this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything
You better turn me on tonight

Here I am
And you’re a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey, I ain’t naive

Here I am
And you’re a Rocket Queen, oh, yeah
I might be too much
But honey, you’re a bit obscene

Here I am
And you’re a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young
But honey, I ain’t naive

Here I am
And you’re a Rocket Queen, oh, yeah
I might be too much
But honey, you’re a bit obscene

I see you standing
Standing on your own
It’s such a lonely place for you
For you to be

If you need a shoulder
Or if you need a friend
I’ll be here standing
Until the bitter end

No one needs the sorrow
No one needs the pain
I hate to see you
Walking out there
Out in the rain

So don’t chastise me
Or think I, I mean you harm
Or those that take you
Leave you strung out
Much too far
Baby, yeah

Don’t ever leave me
Say you’ll always be there
All I ever wanted
Was for you
To know that I care

--Reckless Life

Hey fuckers
Suck on Guns n’ fuckin’ Roses
I’m reckless and feelin’ no pain
You know I’ve got no need to control
Livin’ with the danger
I’m always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Livin’ like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain and you know I know my part
On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I’m living on a cigarette with wine
I’m never alone ’cause I’ve got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Livin’ like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
’Cause it’s comin’ from my heart
I lead a reckless life
And I don’t need your advice
I lead a reckless life
And you know it’s my only vice
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it’s my only
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it’s my only
Hey, hey, yeah

--Nice Boys

She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smellin’ sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big you know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home
I said nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
I’m not a nice boy
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin’ flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made
You know nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
I’m not a nice boy and I never was
Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with a flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys never don’t play rock and roll
I bet you mama said
’Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys don’t play rock and roll
Nice boys

--Move to the City

You pack your bags And you move to the city
There’s somethin’ missin’ here at home
You fix your hair and you’re lookin’ real pretty
It’s time to get it out on your own
You’re always fightin’ with your mama and you papa
Your family life is one big pain!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
You stole your mama’s car
And your daddy’s plastic credit card
You’re sixteen and you can’t get a job
You’re not goin’ very far
You’re always ridin’ with the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
Right to the city Where the real men get it
Aw, child, ain’t it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me
You’re on the streets And it ain’t so pretty
You need to get a new what you please
You do what you gotta do for the money
At times you end up on your knees
I’m always buyin’ With the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain!
But you, you had to move to the city
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
Oh right to the city With the real nitty gritty
Aw, child, ain’t it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me

--Patience

One, two, one, two, three, four
Shed a tear ’cause I’m missin’ you
I’m still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn’t sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you’re in my heart now
Said "woman take it slow, and it’ll work itself out fine"
All we need is just a little patience
Said "sugar make it slow and we’ll come together fine"
All we need is just a little patience (Patience)
Mm, yeah
I sit here on the stairs
’Cause I’d rather be alone
If I can’t have you right now, I’ll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can’t speed up the time
But you know love there’s one more thing to consider
Said "woman take it slow and things will be just fine"
You and I’ll just use a little patience
Said "sugar take the time ’cause the lights are shining bright"
You and I’ve got what it takes to make it
We won’t fake it, I’ll never break it
’Cause I can’t take it
Little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah (I’ve been walking the streets at night)
Just trying to get it right (A little patience, yeah)
It’s hard to see with so many around
You know I don’t like being stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience, yeah)
And the streets don’t change but maybe the names
I ain’t got time for the game ’cause I need you (Gotta have more patience, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah but I need you (All need more patience)
Oh, I need you (All need some patience)
Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)
Ooh this time (Is all you need)

--Used to Love Her

I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her, oh yeah but I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complain
I used to love her, oh yeah but I had to kill her
I used to love her, ooh yeah but I had to kill her
I knew I’ll miss her so I had to keep her
She’s buried right in my back yard
Oh yeah, ooh yeah, whoa oh yeah
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, ooh yeah but I had to kill her
She bitched so much, she drove me nuts
And now I’m happier this way
Whoa oh yeah
(Take it for what it is)
I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, ooh yeah but I had to kill her
I had to put her six, ooh, feet under
And I can still hear her complain

--Youre crazy

Lookin’ for a heart

--One in a Million

One, two, one, two, three, four
Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind
Some peace of mind that’ll stay
So I thumbed it down to sixth in L.A.
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way
Police and niggers, that’s right
Get outta my way
Don’t need to buy none of your
Gold chains today
Now don’t need no bracelets
Clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket, ’til then
Won’t you cut me some slack
You’re one in a million
Yeah that’s what you are
You’re one in a million babe
You’re a shooting star
Maybe some day we’ll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much to high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Immigrants and faggots
They make no sense to me
They come to our country
And think they’ll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran
Or spread some fucking disease
And they talk so many goddamn ways
It’s all Greek to me
Well some say I’m lazy
And others say that’s just me
Some say I’m crazy
I guess I’ll always be
But it’s been such a long time
Since I knew right from wrong
It’s all the means to and end and
I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
You’re one in a million
You’re a shooting star
You’re one in a million babe
You know that you are
Maybe someday we’ll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Radicals and racists
Don’t point your finger at me
I’m a small town white boy
Just tryin’ to make ends meet
Don’t need your religion
Don’t watch that much TV
Just makin’ my livin’ baby
Well that’s enough for me
You’re one in a million
Yeah that’s what you are
You’re one in a million babe
You’re a shooting star
Maybe some day we’ll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high yeah, yeah, yeah
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high yeah, yeah, yeah

Much too high

----Use Your Illusion I

--Right Next Door to Hell

I’ll take a nicotine, caffeine, sugar fix
Jesus, don’t you get tired of turnin’ tricks?
But when your innocence dies, you’ll find the blues
Seems all our heroes were born to lose
Just walkin’ through time, you believe this heat?
Another empty house, another dead end street
Gonna rest my bones, sit for a spell
This side of heaven is close to hell
Right next door to hell
Why don’t you write a letter to me?
I said, "I’m right next door to hell"
And so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
I got nowhere else to be
Right next door to hell
Feels like the walls are closin’ in on me
My mama never really said much to me
She was much too young and scared to be
Hell, Freud might say that’s what I need
But all I really ever get is greed
And most my friends, they feel the same
Hell, we don’t even have ourselves to blame
But times are hard, and thrills are cheaper
As your arms get shorter, your pockets get deeper
Right next door to hell
Why don’t you write a letter to me?
’Cause, I’m right next door to hell
And so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
I never thought this is where I’d be
But I’m right next door to hell
Thinking time ’ill stand still for me
Fuck you, bitch!
Not bad kids, just stupid ones, yeah
Thought we’d own the world an’ getting used was havin’ fun
I said we’re not sad kids, but lucid ones, yeah
Flowin’ through life, not collecting anyone
So much out there, still so much to see
Time’s too much to handle, time’s too much for me
It drove me up the wall and drove me out of my mind
Can you tell me what this means, huh?

--Dust N’ Bones

He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
On "65"
She loved him yesterday
Yesterday’s over
I said okay
That’s all right
Time moves on
That’s the way
We live an hope to see the next day
That’s all right
Sometimes these things they are so easy
Sometimes these things they are so cold
Sometimes these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no man don’t let ’em get to you, yeah
She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister
She said okay
An that’s all right
Buried her things today
Way back out deep
Behind the driveway
And that’s all right
Sometimes these women are so easy
Sometimes these women are so cold
Sometimes these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let ’em get to you
Ya get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you forget about your home
And then you’re just fuckin’ gone
There’s no logic here today
Do as you got to, go your own way
I said that’s right
Time’s short your life’s your own
And in the end
We are just
Dust n’ bones
Dust n’ bones
Dust n’ bones
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
An’ that’s all right
(Dust’n’bone)
That’s all right

That’s all right
Just dust’n’bones, yeah

--Live and Let Die

When you were young and your heart
Was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changin’ world
In which we’re livin’
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
What did it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changin’ world
In which we’re livin’
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

--Dont Cry

Talk to me softly
There’s something in your eyes
Don’t hang your head in sorrow
And please don’t cry
I know how you feel inside I’ve
I’ve been there before
Somethin’s changin’ inside you
And don’t you know
Don’t you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don’t you cry tonight
Don’t you cry tonight
There’s a heaven above you, baby
And don’t you cry tonight
Give me a whisper
And give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you
Tell me goodbye
Don’t you take it so hard now
And please don’t take it so bad
I’ll still be thinkin’ of you
And the times we had, baby
And don’t you cry tonight
Don’t you cry tonight
Don’t you cry tonight
There’s a heaven above you, baby
And don’t you cry tonight
And please remember
That I never lied
Oh and please remember
How I felt inside now, honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you’ll be alright now, sugar
You’ll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now, baby
And don’t you cry tonight
And don’t you cry tonight
And don’t you cry tonight
There’s a heaven above you, baby
And don’t you cry
Don’t you ever cry, cry, cry
Don’t you cry tonight
Baby, maybe someday
Don’t you cry
Don’t you ever cry, cry cry
Don’t you cry
Tonight

--Perfect Crime

Kickin’ back in the shadows
Got no need for the light
Who’s sorry now old timer
Look at how you’ve spent your life
Scroungin’ for change
To put some money in your pocket
My how scratch does burn
Laughin’ at the fuckers as you piss it away
But I got the time and I got the muscle
I got the need to lay it all on the line
I ain’t afraid of your smoke screen hustle
It’s a perfect crime
God dammit it’s a perfect crime
Mother fucker it’s a perfect crime
I said it’s perfect
An keep the demons down
And drag the skeletons out
I got a blind man followin’ me in chains
I said he’s fun to watch
When the world has stopped
An I think he’s got somethin’ to say
"You want to fuck with me? Don’t fuck with me
’Cause I’m what you’ll be, so don’t fuck with me
If you had better sense
You’d step aside from the bad side of me
Don’t fuck wit da bad side o’ me
Stay way from the bad side o’ me
Don’t fuck wit da bad side"
T minus 1:09 and counting
Ostracized but that’s all right
I was thinkin’ about somethin’ myself
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Call on everybody who’s got last rites
Said it’s better
If you locked ’em away
Runnin’ through the visions
At the speed of light
Won’t ya let me be
Mother fucker just let me be
God dammit better let me be
Don’t ya know ya better let me aaahh!
Perfect crime
God dammit it’s a a perfect crime
Mother fucker it’s a perfect crime
Don’t ya know it’s a perfect crime

--You Ain’t the First

Rolling?
One, two, three
One, two, three

But your head’s so far
From the realness of truth
Was it just a come on in the dark
Wasn’t meant to last long
I think you’ve worn your welcome honey
I’ll just see you along as I sing you this song
One, two, three, one
Time can pass slowly
Things always change
Your day’s been numbered
And I’ve read your last page
You was just a temporary love
But honey you ain’t the first
Lots of other come before you woman
Said but you been the worst
Said you been the worst
So goodbye to you girl
So long, farewell
I can’t hear you cryin’
Your jivin’s been hell
So look for me walkin’
Down your street at night
I’ll be in with another
Deep down inside
Deep down inside

He said I’m sick in the brain
He said you ain’t special
So who you foolin’
Don’t try ta give me a line
But I can’t stop thinkin’ ’bout doin’ it one more time
(Oh no)
But I already left you and you’re better off left behind
(Oh yeah)
Aw it’s a bad obsession
It’s always messin’
It’s always messin’ my mind

Oh baby, pretty baby
Oh honey, you let me down honey

To even the score
So stake your claim
Your claim to fame
But baby call another name
When you feel the fire
And taste the flame
Back off, back off bitch

Face of an angel with the love of a witch

You better back off, back off bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch

Found a head and an arm in da garbage can
Don’t know why I’m here
Livin’ on the run for oh so long

Double talkin’ jive get the money motherfucker

Double talkin’ (lies) no more patience man

--November Rain

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin’ when I hold you
Don’t you know I feel the same?
Nothin’ lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it’s hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We’ve been through this such a long long time
Just tryin’ to kill the pain, ooh yeah
Love is always coming, love is always going
No one’s really sure who’s lettin’ go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowin’ that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me then darlin’ don’t refrain
Or I’ll just end up walkin’ in the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don’t you know you need some time all alone
I know it’s hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn’t time be out to charm you?
Oh, oh, oh
Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don’t you know you need some time all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me when there’s no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness, we still can find a way
’Cause nothin’ lasts forever, even cold November rain
Don’t ya think that you need somebody?
Don’t ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You’re not the only one
You’re not the only one
Don’t ya think that you need somebody?
Don’t ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You’re not the only one
You’re not the only one
Don’t ya think that you need somebody?
Don’t ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You’re not the only one
You’re not the only one
Don’t ya think that you need somebody?
Don’t ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody

--The Garden

You know you’re all alone
Your friends they aren’t at home
Everybody’s gone to the garden
As you look into the trees
You can look but you don’t see
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody’s there, but you don’t seem to care
What’s it with you man, and this garden, oh yeah
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man’s utopia
If you’re lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden’s song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
You can find it all inside
No need to wrestle with your pride
No you ain’t losin’ your mind
You’re just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself
Or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside
For the garden, oh yeah
I wasn’t really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering ’round for days
With a smile upon my face
I never wanna to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden’s song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man’s utopia
If you’re lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Bye bye
So long, bye bye
It’s glad to know ya
Bye bye
Bye
Aw so long

--Garden of Eden

It’s a critical solution, and the east coast got the blues
It’s a mass of confusion, like the lies they sell to you
You got a glass-jawed toothache of a mental disease
And they be running ’round back, see them line up on their knees
’Cause the kiss-ass sycophants, throwing penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go
Watch them come in off the streets
While they’re banging out front
Inside they’re slamming to the crunch
Go on an throw me to the lions
And the whole damn screaming bunch
’Cause the pissed-off rip-offs, they’re everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation’s ever supposed to learn
This fire is burning, and it’s out of control
It’s not a problem you can stop
It’s rock n’ roll
I read it on a wall, it went straight to my head
It said, "Dance to the tension of a world on edge"
We got racial violence, and who’ll cast the first stone?
And sex is used any way it can be
Sometimes, when I look out, it’s hard to see the day
It’s a feeling, you can have it, it’s not mine to take away
Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we’re lost in the Garden of Eden
And there’s no one who’s gonna believe this
But we’re lost in the Garden of Eden
This fire is burning, and it’s out of control
It’s not a problem you can stop
It’s rock n’ roll
Suck on that
Looking through this point of view
There’s no way I’m gonna fit in
No, you tell me what my eyes see
Don’t you tell me who to believe in
I ain’t superstitious, but I know when something’s wrong
I’ve been dragging my heels with a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along
Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we’re lost in the Garden of Eden
And there’s no one who’s gonna believe this
But we’re lost in the Garden of Eden, come on
Most organized religions make a mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous and out of control
The Garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said, if they had someone to buy it
Said, I’m sure they’d sell my soul
This fire is burning, and it’s out of control
It’s not a problem you can stop
It’s rock n’ roll
Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we’re lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, there’s no one who’s gonna believe this
But we’re lost in the Garden of Eden
This fire is burning, and it’s out of control
It’s not a problem you can stop
It’s rock n’ roll

--dont damn me

Don’t damn me when I speak a piece of my mind
’Cause silence isn’t golden
When I’m holding it inside
’Cause I’ve been where I have been
An I’ve seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
’Cause it’s all a part of me
Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Your words once heard they can place you in a faction
My words may disturb but at least there’s a reaction
Sometimes I want to kill
Sometimes I want to die
Sometimes I want to destroy
Sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I could get even
Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give
Sometimes I never give a fuck
It’s only for a while
I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
Didn’t want to be a man
So I hid inside my world
I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind
Don’t damn me when I speak a piece of my mind
’Cause silence isn’t golden
When I’m holding it inside
’Cause I’ve been where I have been
An I’ve seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
’Cause it’s all a part of me
How can I ever satisfy you
An how can I ever make you see
That, deep inside we’re all somebody
An it don’t matter who you want to be
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened
’Cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
And I’m the only witness
To the nature of my crime
But look at what we’ve done
To the innocent and young
Whoa listen to who’s talking
’Cause we’re not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes
And dumped into the brain
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts
You tell me who’s to blame
I know you don’t want to hear me crying
An I know you don’t want to hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions
But your delusions are yours an not mine
We take for granted that we know the whole story
We judge a book by it’s cover and read what we want
Between selected lines
Don’t hail me an don’t idolize the ink
Or I’ve failed in my attentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation is in living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I’ve never pretended
As so many others do intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek
Don’t damn me when I speak a piece a mind
’Cause silence isn’t golden
When I’m holding it inside
I’ve been where I have been
An I’ve seen what I have seen
Put the pen to the paper ’Cause it’s all a part of me
Don’t damn me
I said don’t damn me
I said don’t hail me
Ah, don’t damn me
Smoke ’em if you got ’em
Alright, that sucked

--Bad Apples

Diamonds and fast cars
Money to burn I got my head in the clouds
I got these thoughts to churn
Got my feet in the sand
I got a house on the hill
I got a headache like a mother
Twice the price of my thrills
An it’s a cold day
It’s a continental drift
I said this traffic is hell
Can you give me a lift
An I’ll try to paint a story
Got your pictures to tell
Yeah you got to make a living
With what you bring yourself to sell
I got some genuine
Imitation, bad Apples
Free sample for your peace o’ mind only $9.95
I got my camera back from customs
Got my law fees up to date
Hell they musta seen me comin’
Ain’t this life so fuckin’ great
When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand
Yeah, well I’m a frequent flyer
My body’s breathing while it can
But what I don’t understand is that
My world ain’t gettin’ no brighter
If I could touch the sky
Well I would float on by
While everybody’s talkin’
Hell I’m just another guy
If it were up to me
I’d say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch
Gold and caviarnow why’nt you pour my apathy
I’d have all my bases covered
If I could teach my hands to see
But now we’re down in the deep end
Where they’d love to watch you drown
I said your laundry could use washing
We’ll hang it up all over town
I said Hollywood’s like a dryer
An we’re down on Sunset Strip
An you’ll be suckin’ down the Clorox
’Til your life’s all nice and crisp
When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand
Yeah, well I’m a frequent flyer
My body’s breathing while it can
But what I don’t understand is that
My world ain’t gettin’ no brighter
If I could touch the sky
Well I would float on by
While everybody’s talkin’

Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch
Why let one bad apple
Spoil the whole damn bunch

--Dead Horse

Sick of this life
Not that you’d care
I’m not the only one
With whom these feelings I share
Nobody understands
Quite why we’re here
We’re searchin’ for answers
That never appear
But maybe if I looked real hard I’d
I’d see your tryin’ too
To understand this life
That we’re all goin’ through
(Then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car
I didn’t know what to do)
Sometimes I feel like I’m beatin’ a dead horse
And I don’t know why you’d be bringin’ me down
I’d like to think that our love’s worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you’d think by now
I’d be smilin’
I guess some things never change
Never change
I met an old cowboy
I saw the look in his eyes
Somethin’ tells me he’s been here before
’Cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child
When the thought first came to me
That I’m a son of a gun and the gun of a son
That brought back the devil in me
But sometimes I feel like I’m beatin’ a dead horse
I don’t know why you’d be bringin’ me down
I’d like to think that our love’s worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you’d think by now
I’d be smilin’
I guess some things never change
Never change
I ain’t quite what you’d call an old soul
Still wet behind the ears
I been around this track a couple o’ times
But now the dust is startin’ to clear
Oh yeah
Sometimes I feel like I’m beatin’ a dead horse
I don’t know why you’d be bringin’ me down
I’d like to think that our love’s worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you’d think by now
I’d be smilin’
Ooh yeah, I’d be smilin’
No way I’d be smilin’
Ooh smilin’
Sick of this life
Not that you’d care
I’m not the only one
With whom these feelings I share

--Coma

You’ve caught me in a coma
And I don’t think I wanna
Ever come back to this
World again
Kinda like it in a coma
’Cause no one’s ever gonna
Oh make me come back to this
World again
Now, I feel as if I’m floating away
I can’t feel all the pressure, and I like it this way
But my body’s calling
My body’s calling
Won’t you come back to this world again?
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I’ve got the light at the end, I’ve got the bones on the mast
Well, I’ve gone sailing
I’ve gone sailing
I could leave so easily
My friends are calling back to me, I said, they’re
They’re leavin’ it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is going on
Goddamn it
Slipping farther and farther away
It’s a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that’s full of shit
Okay, let’s get this guy in the program please, we’re losing him (start an IV Please)
Come on, his airways someone’s got to protect his airways I want two
Where’s the defibrillator?
Two IV’s over here please, that’s two more now, we’re losing him (let’s go) (help me)
Okay, respond, we’re losing this guy (help me)
Where’s the, where’s the crash- what’s going on? anyways, in protective two IV’s
(Bastard) slow motion here (let’s get him in ER)
Going out on us
Who’s got the defibrillator?
Please understand me
I’m climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just can’t stifle all my screams
And I’m waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you?
No one’s going to bother me anymore
No one’s going to mess with my head no more
I can’t understand what all the fightin’s for
But it’s so nice here, down off the shore
I wish you could see this, ’cause there’s nothing to see
It’s peaceful here and it’s fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live
Ah
Okay, we’re starting to lose this guy
I want that IV and his airway protected (let’s get some people in here)
Get the crash cart please, we’re losing this guy, he’s going under (give me an airway please)
Clear
Zap him again
How about an IV, stat?
Okay you better protect the airway, you’re starting to lose him (clear)
Zap the son of a bitch again
Listen to me
Axl, are you listening to me?
No, don’t walk away from me "Get back over here
(’You are such a fucking prick, I am so pissed with you)
All I hear is bullshit, all the time
All you ever wanna do is have sex, sex sex
I just don’t give a shit anymore
You live your life like it’s a coma
Won’t you tell me why we’d wanna?
With all the reasons you give, it’s
It’s kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I’ve seen
Any reason why you should stay?
Maybe we’d be better off without you, anyway
You got a one way ticket, on your last chance ride
Got a one way ticket to your suicide
Got a one way ticket, and there’s no way out alive
An’ all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn’t much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is, then there’s stories to be told
No, you don’t need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission, got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you watch ’em waving goodbye
They be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody’s home
When the bell’s stopped ringing
It was nobody’s fault, but your own
There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it coming
But we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one’s listening
Why’d your best friend drop a dime?
Sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
An’ it’s so easy to be social
It’s so easy to be cool
Yeah, it’s easy to be hungry, when you ain’t got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
But I’m still out here, waiting
Watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking
Know it’s gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories
That another man would need just to survive

----Use Your Illusion II

--Civil War

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they’ve always done before
Look at the hate we’re breeding
Look at the fear we’re feeding
Look at the lives we’re leading
The way we’ve always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can’t deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
D’you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said "peace could last forever"
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can’t trust freedom
When it’s not in your hands
When everybody’s fightin’
For their promised land
And
I don’t need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin’ soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain’t that fresh
I don’t need your civil war
Ow, oh no, no, no, no, no
Look at the shoes you’re filling
Look at the blood we’re spilling
Look at the world we’re killing
The way we’ve always done before
Look in the doubt we’ve wallowed
Look at the leaders we’ve followed
Look at the lies we’ve swallowed
And I don’t want to hear no more
My hands are tied
For all I’ve seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
’Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
I don’t need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin’ soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain’t that fresh
I don’t need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don’t need your civil war
I don’t need your civil war
Your power hungry sellin’ soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain’t that fresh
I don’t need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no
I don’t need one more war
I don’t need one more war
No, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no
Whaz so civil ’bout war anyway?

--14 Years

I try and feel the sunshine
You bring the rain
You try and hold me down
With your complaints
You cry and moan and complain
You wine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow
The touch you bring

You just don’t step inside to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that’s what I say
You know, I’ve been the beggar
I’ve played the thief
I was the dog, they all tried to beat

But it’s been
14 years of silence
It’s been
14 years of pain
It’s been
14 years that are gone forever
And I’ll never have again, well

Your stupid girlfriends tell you
That I’m to blame
Well they’re all used-up has-beens
Out of the game
This time I’ll have the last word
Hear what I say
I tried to see it your way
It won’t work today

You just don’t step inside to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that’s what I say
You know, I’ve been the dealer
Hangin’ on your street
I was the dog, they all tried to beat

But it’s been
14 years of silence
It’s been
14 years of pain
It’s been
14 years that are gone forever
And I’ll never have again, well

Let’s get naughtier!

Bullshit and contemplation
Gossip’s their trade
If they knew half the real truth
What would they say
Well I’m past the point of concern
It’s time to play
These last 4 years of madness
Sure put me straight

Don’t get back 14 years
In just one day
So hard to keep my own head
Just go away
You know, just like a hooker, she said
Nothing’s for free
Oh I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way

--Yesterdays

Yesterday, there was so many things
I was never told
Now that I’m startin’ to learn
I feel I’m growin’ old
’Cause yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Old pictures that I’ll always see
Time just fades the pages
In my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket
And no hand in destiny
I’ll keep on movin’ along
With no time to plant my feet
’Cause yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Old pictures that I’ll always see
Some things could be better
If we’d all just let them be
Yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Got nothin’ for me
Yesterday there were so many things
I was never shown
Suddenly this time I found
I’m on the streets and I’m all alone
Yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Old pictures that I’ll always see
I ain’t got time to reminisce old novelties
Yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Yesterday’s got nothin’ for me
Yesterday
Yesterday

--Knocking on heavens door

Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s gettin’ dark, too dark to see
I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin’ down
I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door

--Get in the ring

Why do you look at me when you hate me?
Why should I look at you when you make me hate you too?
I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I don’t even understand why the fuck you even care
And I don’t need your jealousy yeah
Why drag me down in your misery
And when you stare you don’t think I feel it
But I’m gonna deal it back to you in spades
When I’m havin’ fun ya know I can’t conceal it
’cause I know you’d never cut in my game, oh no
And when you’re talkin’ about a vasectomy, yeah
I’ll be writin’ down your obituary...history!
You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair, collagen lip projections
Who are you to criticize my intentions?
Got your subtle manipulative devices
Just like you I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
I’d like to crush your head tight in my vice...pain!!
And that goes for all of you punks in the press
That want to start shit by printin’ lies instead of the things we said
That means you andy secher at hit parader, circus magazine
Mick wall at kerrang, bob guccione jr. at spin
What you pissed off ’cause your dad gets more pussy than you?
Fuck you! suck my fuckin’ dick!
You be rippin’ off the fuckin’ kids
While they be payin’ their hard earned money to read about the bands they want to know about
Printin’ lies, startin’ controversy
You want to antagonize me? antagonize me motherfucker!
Get in the ring motherfucker! and I’ll kick your bitchy little ass! punk!!
I don’t like you, I just hate you
I’m gonna kick your ass, oh yeah! oh yeah!
You may not like our integrity yeah
We built a world out of anarchy oh yeah!
And in this corner, weighing in at 850 pounds; guns n’ roses!
Get in the ring(x16)
This song is dedicated to all the guns n’ fuckin’ roses fans
Who stuck with us through all the fucking shit
And to all those opposed...hmm...well...

--Shotgun Blues

I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
I said I don’t know what I did
But I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
I can’t wait here forever
I got too much here to lose
An now you’re blowin’ smoke
I think you’re one big joke
Me...I gotta lot to learn
An I’m still waitin’ for the heads to turn
You say I walk a line
Fuck they move it every time
You walk a mile in my shoes
And then you tell me ’bout singin’ the blues
You get what you pay for
An freedom’s real high priced
An while your rippin’ off children
Somebody’s fuckin’ your wife
It’s never made a difference
It’s only how you survive
I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
I said I don’t know what I did
But I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
I can’t wait here forever
I got too much here to lose
An now you ask me why
I said it’s do or die
I’ll stick it right in your face
And then I’ll put you in your motherfuckin’ place
And you...you can suck my ass
An I think it’s so low class
Me...I’m just so concerned
I’m still waitin’ for your ass to burn
Ooooh you want a confrontation
I’ll give you every fuckin’ chance
With your verbal masturbation
Me...I just like to dance
How’s that for provocation
I’m just makin’ a stance
An I’m tired of the frustration
Of livin’ inside of your lies
And I’m wired on indignation
I said somebody’s got to die
I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
I said I don’t know what I did
But I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
I can’t stay here forever
I got too much here to lose
I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
Listen motherfucker
You’re about to pay your dues
I got the shotgun blues
Shotgun blues
If you’re goin’ up against me
Then you know you’re gonna lose
I know
I know (there’s ways- that we- can find)
I know
I know
You think anyone with an I.Q. over fifteen
Would believe your shit...fuckhead
Nothin’ but a fuckin’ pussy

--Breakdown

We all come in from the cold
We come down from the wire
An everybody warms themselves
To a different fire
When sometimes we get burned
You’d think sometime we’d learn
The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You ain’t got no one
You better go back out and find her
Just like children hidin’ in a closet
Can’t tell what’s goin’ on outside
Sometimes we’re so far off the beaten track
We’ll get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
Could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darlin’ sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds
When I look around
Everybody always brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can’t see
But there ain’t no peace to found
But if someone really cared
Well they’d take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one’s despair
Remember in this game we call life
That no one said it’s fair
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Yeah
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Get down with yo’ bad self
Alright
I’ve come to know the cold
I think of it as home
When there ain’t enough of me
To go around
I’d rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit
I’m out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me
If I fit you needs
Like when we both knew we had it
But now the damage’s done
And we’re back out on the run
Fun how ev’rything was roses
When we held on to the guns
Just because you’re winnin’
Don’t mean you’re the lucky ones
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Yeah
Breakdown
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
There goes the Challenger being chased
By the blue blue meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad cars are
After our lone driver
The last American hero
The the electric sitar
The demi-god
The super driver of the golden west!
Two nasty nazi cars are close behind
The beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting closer-closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile yeah baby!
They about to strike, they gonna get him, smash! rape!
The last beautiful free soul on this planet
But it is written if the evil spirit
Arms the tiger with claws
Brahman provided wings for the dove
Thus spake the super guru"
"Did you hear that"

--Pretty Tied Up

I know this chick she lives down on Melrose
She ain’t satisfied without some pain
Friday night is goin’ up inside her...again
Well crack the whip
’Cause that bitch is just insane
I’m serious
She’s pretty tied up hangin’ upside down
She’s pretty tied up an you can ride her
She’s pretty tied up hangin’ upside down
I can’t tell you she’s the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Once there was this rock n’ roll band
Rollin’ on the streets
Time went by and it became a joke
We just needed more and more fulfilling... uh-huh
Time went by and it all went up in smoke
But check it out
She’s pretty tied up hangin’ upside down
She’s pretty tied up an you can ride her
She’s pretty tied up hangin’ upside down
Ohh I can’t tell you she’s the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Once you made that money it costs more now
It might cost a lot more than you’d think
I just found a million dollars
that someone forgot
It’s days like this that push me o’er the brinks
Cool and stressing
[pronounced: cool ranch dres’ing]
She’s pretty tied up hangin’ upside down
She’s pretty tied up an you can ride her
She’s pretty tied up hangin’ upside down
And I can’t tell you she’s the right one
Oh she’s the right one ...(etc.)
(but I can tell you a thing or two
’bout somethin’ else
If you really want to know...know what I’m sayin’)

--Locomotive

Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah I’ll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you’re my friend
And our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hopin’ that you’d find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won’t take the love I have to give
I bought me an illusion
An I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all
But oh the taste is never so sweet
As what you’d believe it is -
Well I guess it never is
It’s these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood
To the heart of the biz
You know I never thought
That it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me
But it feels as though you raped me
’Cause you climbed inside my world
And in my songs
So now I’ve closed the door
To keep the cold outside
Seems somehow I’ve found the will to live
But how can I forget you
Or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive
Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I’d like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no
You could sell your body on the street
To anyone whom you might meet
Who’d love to try and get inside
And bust your innocence open wide
’Cause my baby’s got a locomotive
My baby’s gone off the track
My baby’s got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I’m insane
Take a closer look I’m not to blame
No
Gonna have some fun with my frustrations
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I’d rather take a detour
’cause this road ain’t gettin’ clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
Better tame that boy ’cause he’s a wild one
Better tame that boy for he’s a man
Sweetheart don’t make me laugh
You’s gettin’ too big for your pants
And I’s think maybe you should
Cut out while you can
You can use your illusion -
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it’s best to walk away
Me I’m just here hangin’ on
It’s my only place to stay at least
For now anyway
I’ve worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away
I’m taking time quiet consolation
In passing by this love that’s passed away
I know it’s never easy
So why should you believe me
When I’ve always got so many things to say
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
’Cause playful hearts
Can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page
Kindness is a treasure
And it’s one towards me you’ve seldom shown
So I’d say it for a good measure
To all the ones like you I’ve known
Ya know I’d like to shave your head
And all my friends could paint it red
’Cause love to me’s a two way street
An all I really want is peace
But my baby’s got a locomotive
My baby’s gone off the track
My baby’s got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I’m insane
Take a closer look I’m not to blame
No
Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether
But the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah I know it’s hard to face
When all we’ve worked for’s gone to waste
But you’re such a stupid woman
And I’m such a stupid man
But love like time’s got its own plans
’Cause my baby’s got a locomotive
My baby’s gone off the track
My baby’s got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I’m insane
Take a closer look I’m not to blame
Yeah
If love is blind I guess I’ll buy myself a cane
Love’s so strange

--So fine

How could she look so fine
How could it be she might be mine
How could she be so cool
I’ve been taken for a fool
So many times
It’s a story of a man
Who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns
As the story takes it turn
An leaves a broken man
How could she be so cool
How could she be so fine
I owe a favor to a friend
My friends, they always come through for me Yeah
It’s a story of a man
Who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns
As the story takes it turn
An leaves a broken man
If you could only live my life
You could see the difference you make to me
To me I’d look right up at night
And all I’d see was darkness
Now I see the stars alright
I want to reach right up and grab one for you
When the lights went down in your house
Yeah that made me happy
The sweat I make for you Yeah...
I think you know where that comes from
Well I’d look right up at night
And all I’d see was darkness
Now I see the stars alright
I want to reach right up and grab one for you
When the lights went down in your house
Yeah that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
I think you know where that comes from (2×)
How could she look so good (So good)
How could she be so fine
How could she be so cool
How could it be she might be mine

--Estranged

When you’re talkin’ to yourself
And nobody’s home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone
(Alone)
So nobody ever told you baby
How it was gonna be
So what’ll happen to you baby
Guess we’ll have to wait and see
One, two
Old at heart but I’m only twenty eight
And I’m much too young
To let love break my heart
Young at heart but it’s getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart
I don’t know how you’re s’posed to find me lately
An what more could you ask from me
How could you say that I never needed you
When you took everything
Said you took everything from me
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but I musn’t hesitate
If I’m to find my own way out
Still talkin’ to myself
And nobody’s home
(Alone)
So nobody ever told us baby
How it was gonna be
So what’ll happen to us baby
Guess we’ll have to wait and see
When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I’ll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe I’ll get it right next time
An now that you’ve been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You’re back down on the ground
And you don’t talk so loud
An you don’t walk so proud
Any more, and what for
Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I’m out here on my own, an drifting all alone
If it doesn’t show give it time
To read between the lines
’Cause I see the storm getting closer
And the waves they get so high
Seems everything we’ve ever known’s here
Why must it drift away and die
I’ll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I’ll have to make it through, this time - oh this time
Without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we’ve ever known’s here
I never wanted it to die

--You Could be Mine

I’m a cold heartbreaker
Fit to burn and I’ll rip your heart in two
And I’ll leave you lyin’ on the bed
I’ll be out the door before you wake
It’s nothin’ new to you
’Cause I think we’ve seen that movie too, oh
’Cause you could be mine
But you’re way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin’
And your cocaine tongue
You get nothin’ done
I said you could be mine, oh
Now holidays come and then they go
It’s nothin’ new today
Collect another memory
When I come home late at night
Don’t ask me where I’ve been
Just count your stars I’m home again, oh
’Cause you could be mine
But you’re way out of line, ow
With your bitch slap rappin’
And your cocaine tongue
You get nothin’ done
I said you could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine
Ooh, you’ve gone sketchin’ too many times
Ooh, why don’t you give it a rest
Why must you find
Another reason to cry?
While you’re breakin’ down my back and
I been rackin’ out my brain
It don’t matter how we make it
’Cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage
But your flaps are wearin’ thin
And I could sleep on it ’til mornin’
But this nightmare never ends
Don’t forget to call my lawyers
With ridiculous demands
And you can take the pity so far
But it’s more than I can stand
’Cause this couch-trip’s gettin’ older
Tell me, how long has it been?
’Cause five years is forever
And you haven’t grown up yet
Oh, you could be mine
But you’re way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin’
And your cocaine tongue
You get nothin’ done
I said you could be
You should be
You could be mine
Oh, you could be mine (you could be mine)
You could be mine (you could be mine)
Oh, you could be mine (you could be mine)
You could be mine (you could be mine)
Oh, you could be mine (you could be mine)
Come on, you could be mine (you could be mine)
Oh, you could be mine (you could be mine)
You could be mine, yeah

--Don’t Cry

If we could see tomorrow
What of your plans
No one can live in sorrow
Ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride they’re
Back in demand
I was the one who’s washing
Blood off your hands

Don’t you cry tonight
I still love you baby
Don’t you cry tonight
Don’t you cry tonight
There’s a heaven above you baby
And don’t you cry tonight

I know the things you wanted
They’re not what you have
With all the people talkin’
It’s drivin’ you mad
If I was standin’ by you
How would you feel
Knowing your love’s decided
And all love is real, baby

And don’t you cry tonight
Don’t you cry tonight
Don’t you cry tonight
There’s a heaven above you baby
And don’t you cry tonight

I thought I could live in your world
As years all went by
With all the voices
I’ve heard
Something has died
And when you’re in need of someone
My heart won’t deny you
So many seem so lonely
With no one left to cry to baby

And don’t you cry tonight
And don’t you cry tonight
And don’t you cry tonight
There’s a heaven above you baby
And don’t you cry
Don’t you ever cry
Don’t you cry
Don’t you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday
Don’t you cry
Don’t you ever cry
Don’t you cry
Don’t you cry tonight

--My world

You wan’da step into my world
It’s a sociopsychotic state of bliss
You’ve been delayed in the real world
How many times have you hit and missed?
Your cat-scan shows disfiguration
I want to laugh myself to death
With a misfired synapse
With a bent configuration
I’ll hold the line while you gasp for breath
You want to talk to me
So talk to me
You want to talk to me (7x)
You can’t talk to me
You don’t understand your sex
You ain’t been mindfucked yet
Let’s do it (3x)
Oh my distorted smile
Guess what I’m doing now

----Chinese Democracy

--Chinese Democracy

It don’t really matter
gonna find out for yourself
No it don’t really matter
You’re gonna leave this thing to somebody else
If they missionaries
Real time visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatuation
I know that I’m a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They’ve seen the end and you can’t hold on now
’Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination, even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all I’ve got is precious time
It don’t really matter
Guess I’ll keep it to myself
Said, it don’t really matter
It’s time I look around for somebody else
’Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation, even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all we’ve got is precious time
More than you got to fool the nation
But all I’ve got is precious time
It don’t really matter
I guess you’ll find out for yourself
No, it don’t really matter
So you can hear it now from somebody else
You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat ’em enough, they’ll die
It’s like a walk in the park from a cell
Now you’re keeping your own kind in hell
When your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself
While their arms reach out for your help
And you’re out of time

--shacklers Revenge

I’ve got a funny feeling there’s something wrong today
I’ve got a funny feeling and it won’t go away
I’ve got an itchy finger and there’ll be hell to pay
I’m gonna pull the trigger and blow them all away
Don’t ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don’t ever try to tell me how you were there for me
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I hope you see this)
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I don’t regret this)
I’ve got a wicked demon inside that never fades
I’ve got an empty feeling I won’t be home today
Don’t ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don’t ever try to tell me how you were there for me
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I hope you see this)
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I don’t regret this)
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I hope you see this)
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I don’t regret this)
I want you to stop and help out with doing what you want to do
No one is guilty here now, there’s nothing new now
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I hope you see this)
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I don’t regret this)
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I hope you see this)
I don’t believe there’s a reason (I don’t regret this)

--Better

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I’d know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I’d know better, better
The hardest part this troubled heart
Has never yet been through now
Was heal the scars that got their start
Inside someone like you now
For had I known or I’d been shown
Back when how long it’d take me
To break the charms that brought me harm
And all that would erase me
I never would or thought I could
No matter what you’d pay me
Replay the part, you stole my heart
I should have known you’re crazy
If all I knew was that with you
I’d want someone to save me
It’d be enough, but just my luck
I fell in love and maybe
All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
You know, I know better
Now I know you better
So bittersweet, this tragedy
Won’t ask for absolution
This melody inside of me
Still searches for solution
A twist of fate, a change of heart
Cures my infatuation
I’m a broken heart, provides the spark
For my determination
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I’d know better, better
Oh, no one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I’d know better, better
All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
You know, I know better
Now I know you better
I never wanted you to be so full of anger (anger)
I never wanted you to be somebody else
I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves
I only wanted you to see things for yourself
All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
Now we all know better
All that I wanted was
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
If I were you I’d manage to
Avoid the invitation
Of promised love that can’t keep up
With your adoration
Just use your head and in the end
You’ll find your inspiration
To choose your steps and won’t regret
This kind of aggravation
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I’d know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I’d know better, better

--Street of Dreams

All the love in the world couldn’t save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
Oh I wanna make you change your mind
And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldn’t want to be you
Now there’s a hell I can’t describe
So now I wander through my days
Trying to find my ways
To the feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else
And though as long as this road seems
I know it’s called the street of dreams
But that’s not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that’s bittersweet
That’s called the blues
I don’t know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it’s what you planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful, don’t live inside of you anymore
I don’t know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it’s what you planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful, don’t live inside of you anymore
What this means to me
Is more than I know you believe
What I thought of you now
Has cost more that it should for me
What I thought was true before
Were lies I couldn’t see
What I thought was beautiful
Is only memories

--If the World

If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there’s nothing more to say
If the world would end would our love slip away
I never knew the way that you looked at me
Would ever mean so much to me
In my heart I found the feelings that I’ve never shown
Now they’ve got the best of me
If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there’s nothing more to say
If the world would end would our love slip away
I never thought all the love I was looking for
Could ever be so close to me
Your the only one that I’ve ever loved that has ever loved me
And now you’ve got the best of me
If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there’s nothing more to say
If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there’s nothing more to say
If the world would end would our love slip away

--There was a time

Broken glass and cigarettes,
Writing on the wall,
It was a bargain for the summer,
And I thought I had it all.
I was the one who gave you everything,
The one who took the fall,
You were the one who would do anything,
The one who can’t recall
Where she was while she was sleeping,
In another woman’s bed,
Or the doctors or the lawyers,
Or a stranger that she met.
If there’s nothing I can gain from this,
Or anything at all,
It’d be the knowledge that ya gave me,
When I thought I had it all.
It was a long time with you,
It was a long time with me,
It’d be a long for anyone,
But looks like it’s meant to be.
Social class and registers,
Cocaine in the hall,
All the way from California,
On the way beyond that stall.
To those non-negotiations
To simulate a call,
All the bad of learning evils and your ways around the laws that keep you
Up and sitting pretty,
On a pedestal of men
And now you’re sleeping like an angel,
Near the man who reaped it in.
If there’s something I can make of this,
Or anything at all,
It’d be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all.
It was a wrong time for you,
It was a wrong time for me,
It was the wrong time for everyone
But looks like I’m about to see for myself.
If I could go back in time to the place in my soul, there all alone
Lonely tear drops,
Ooh, are calling you.
But I don’t wanna know it now,
’cause knowing you, it won’t change a damn thing.
But there was a time.
Yeah, there was a time,
Didn’t wanna know it all,
Didn’t wanna know it all and
I don’t wanna know it now
Oh,
Yeah, there was a time,
Didn’t wanna know it all,
Didn’t wanna know it all and
I don’t wanna know it now,
Oh,
I would do anything for you,
There was a time,
I would do anything for you,
Oh, I would do anything for you,
There was a time.
There was a time,
Oh, I would do anything for you,
Oh, I would do anything for you
Yeah there was a time,
Didn’t wanna know it all,
Didn’t wanna know it all,
And I don’t wanna know it now,
I would do anything for you,
There was a time, was a time

--Catcher in the Rye

When all is said and done
We’re not the only ones
Who look at life this way
That’s what the old folks say
But every time I’d see them
Makes me wish I had a gun
If I thought that I was crazy
Well I guess I’d have more fun
Guess I’d have more fun
Oh no, no, no, no, no
The Catcher in the Rye again ooh
Won’t let ya get away from him
It’s just another day like today
You decide
’Cause I don’t have to
Then they’ll find
And I won’t ask you
At anytime
Or long hereafter
If the cold’s outside
As I’m imagining
It to be
Oh no
The Catcher in the Rye again ooh
Won’t let ya get away from him
It’s just another day like today
When all is said and done
We’re not the only ones
Who look at life this way
That’s what the young folks say
But every time I’d see them
Makes me wish I had a gun
If I thought that I was crazy
Well I guess I’d have more fun
It’s what used to be’s not there for me
And ought to find someone that belongs insane like I do
Oh no
Not at all [Repeat]
On an ordinary day
Not in an ordinary way
All at once the song I heard
No longer wouldn’t play for anybody
Or anyone
That needed comfort from somebody
Needed comfort from someone who cared
To be
Not like you
And unlike me
And then then voices ran away
From me
So now you set the wheels in motion
It haunts our memories
You were the instrument
You were the one
How a body took a body
And Gave that boy a gun
You took our innocence
Beyond our stares
Sometimes the only thing
You got at all
When no one else is there

--Scraped

Don’t you try and stop us now
I just refuse
Don’t you try to stop us now
’Cause I just won’t let you
Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me
Breaking me down with an endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like there’s nothing that’s stopping me
All things are possible, I am unstoppable
So they convince you no one can break through
I’m here to tell you you’re worth more than they tell you
Don’t you try and stop us now
I just refuse
Don’t you try to stop us now
’Cause I just won’t let you
Sometimes I feel like my life’s a catastrophe
Can’t understand why it seems like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like it’s all opened up for me
Nothing’s impossible, I am unconquerable
No one can make you do what they want to
You know you’re stronger than the lies that they tell you
So they convince you no one can break through
You know you’re stronger than the lies that they tell you
Don’t you try and stop us now
I just refuse
Don’t you try to stop us now
’Cause I just won’t let you

--Riad N’ the Bedouins

Riad N’ The Bedouins
Had a plan and thought they’d win
But I don’t give a fuck ’bout them
’Cause I am crazy
Oh, my salvation
All my frustrations
Caught in the lies no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, oh
Riad N’ The Bedouins
Say that’s a war that you can’t win
But I have had enough of them
And who can blame me
Sent down on desert winds
Nomads and barbarians
I won’t bend my will to them
You aggravate me
Oh, my salvation
All my frustrations
Caught in the lies no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, oh
Riad N’ The Bedouins
Had a plan and though they’d win
Riad N’ The Bedouins
Crossed the line and lost again

--Sorry

You like to hurt me you know that you do
You like to think in some way that its me and not you
You like to have me jump and be good, but I don’t want to do it
You don’t know why I wont act the way you think I should
You thought they’d make me, behave and submit
What were you thinking, cause I don’t forget
You don’t know why
I wont give in
To hell with the pressure
I’m not caving in
You know that I got under your skin
You sold your soul but I wont let you win
You talk to much
You say I do
Difference is know one cares about you
You’ve got all the answers
You know everything
Well nobody asked you
Its a mystery to me
I’m sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)
You don’t know who in the hell to or not to believe
I’m sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)
You don’t know who you can trust now
But you should believe
You should believe
You close your eyes
All well and good
I’ll kick your ass like I said that I would
You tell them story’s they’d rather believe
Use and confuse them their numb and naive
Truth is the truth hurts don’t you agree
Its harder to live with the truth about you
Than to live with the lies about me
Know body owes you
Not one god damn thing
You know where to put your
Just shut up and say
I’m sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)
You don’t know who in the hell to or not to believe
I’m sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)
You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free

--I.R.S.

Love
Is it true
What they say of you
Gonna call the President
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need the FBI
There’s not anymore that I can do
All the reasons that you give
I follow you
So when you lead them in, that’ll be the end of time it’s true
Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve been wrong
Wouldn’t be the last I’m sure, I’ve known
With all the rumors I can tell
Some things didn’t work so well
Well anyway, it feels the same
As when you first told me you were gone
So long ago but I still held on
Through all the emotions that I’ve had to take
And that’s the truth, and here’s the worst yet
Wouldn’t even matter the things that I say
You’ve made your mind up and gone anyway
And there’s no use now in dragging it on
Should’ve seen it coming all along
Well it’s true, oh, I had
My doubts of you
Gonna call the President
Gonna call myself a private eye
Gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it baby with your morning news
With a sweet hangover
And the headlines too, now
I bet you think I’m doing this all for my health
I should’ve looked again then at somebody else
Feelin’ like I’ve done way more than wrong
Feelin’ like I’m livin’ inside of this song
Feelin’ like I’m just too tired to care
Feelin’ like I’ve done more than my share
Could’ve been the way that I carried on
Like a broken record for so long
And I do
Oh, oh
I’m gonna call the President
I’m gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need myself the FBI
Oh, what shall I do?
If I gave my heart to you
It’s such a crime you know it’s true
Gonna call the president
Gonna need myself a private eye
Ooh, gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make it a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it baby with your morning news
With the sweet hangover and the headlines too
There’s not anymore that I can do

--Madagascar

I won’t be told anymore
That I’ve been brought down in this storm
Uh and left so far out from the shore
That I can’t find my way back, my way anymore
Oh no I won’t be told anymore
That I’ve been brought down in this storm
And left so far out from the shore
Oh that I can’t find my way back, my way anymore
No, I
No, I
Forgive them that tear down my soul
And bless them that they might grow old
And free them so that they may know
That it’s never too late
For the many times what seemed like a memory
I searched and found the ways you used to lure me in
Oh, I found the ways, oh why it had to be
Mired in denial and saw all the rain
If we ever find it’s true
That we have the strength to choose
Oh, freedom or the chains
We have together
I’m gonna tell you a story
Stand up for righteousness
What? (Stand up for justice)
What? (Stand up for truth)
How can a person grow up with all this around them?
You got to call on that something
Where does it come from?
That can make a way out of no way
All this hatred?
What we’ve got here is
(Fear)
That power that can make a way out of now no way
Failure to communicate
I tell ya I seen the lightning
I’ve heard the thunder roll
Everybody’s acting like we can do anything
And it don’t matter what we do
Maybe we gotta be extra careful
Because maybe it matters more than We even know
Sometimes (hatred isn’t somethin’ you’re born with)
I feel discouraged, it gets taught
Sometimes I feel discouraged, I felt this fear
He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone, no never alone, no never alone
Let’s get something straight, alright?
Promised never to leave me
This whole thing was fucked up
Never to leave me alone
All men betray all lose heart
I don’t want to lose heart, I want to believe
Black men and white men together at the table of brotherhood
I have a dream
Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty we are free at last
Oh I won’t be told anymore (if we ever find it’s true)
That I’ve been brought down in this storm (that we have the strength to choose)
And left so far out from the shore (oh, freedom or the chains)
That I can’t find my way back, my way anymore (we have together)
Oh no I won’t be told anymore (if we ever find it’s true)
That I’ve been brought back in this storm (that we have the strength to choose)
And left so far out from the shore (oh, freedom or the chains)
That I can’t find my way back, my way anymore (we have together)
(Oh, oh)

--This I Love

And now I don’t know why
She wouldn’t say goodbye
But then it seems that I
Had seen it in her eyes
And it might not be wise
I’d still have to try
With all the love I have inside
I can’t deny
I just can’t let it die
’Cause her heart’s just like mine
She holds her pain inside
So if you ask me why
She wouldn’t say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
There is a special light
Still shining bright
And even on the darkest night
She can’t deny
So if she’s somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There’s no one else
Could ever make me feel
I’m so alive
I hoped she’d never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I’ve searched the universe
And found myself
Within’ her eyes
No matter how I try
They say it’s all a lie
So what’s the use of my
Confessions to a crime
Of passions that won’t die
In my heart
So if she’s somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There’s no one else
Could ever make me feel
I’m so alive
I hoped she’d never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I’ve searched the universe
And found myself
Within’ her eyes
So if she’s somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There’s no one else
Could ever make me feel
I’m so alive
I hoped she’d never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I’ve searched the universe
And found myself
Within’ her eyes
And now I don’t know why
She wouldn’t say goodbye
It just might be that I
Had seen it in her eyes
And now it seems that I
Gave up my ghost of pride
I’ll never say goodbye

--Prostitute

Seems like forever and a day
If my intentions are misunderstood
Please be kind
I’ve done all I should
I won’t ask of you
What I would not do
Oh, I saw the damage in you
My fortunate one
The envy of youth
Why would they
Tell me to please those
That laugh in my face
With all of the reasons
They’ve taught
Fall over themselves
To give way, oh yeah
It’s not a question
Whether my heart is true
Streamlined
I had to pull through
Look for a new
Beginning on you
Oh, I, I got a message for you
Up and away
It’s what I gotta do
Give what you have
For what you might lose
What would you say
If I told you that I’m to blame?
And what would you do
If I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you
"I love you"
And then walk away? Oh yeah
N’ who should I turn to
If not for the ones
That you would not save? Alright
I told you when I found you
If there were doubts you
Should be careful and unafraid
Now
They surround you
And all that amounts too
Is love that you fed by
Perversion and pain
So if my affections
Are misunderstood
And you decide
I’m up
To no good
Don’t ask me to
Enjoy them
Just for you
Ask yourself
What I would choose
To prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame
Oh yeah!
When you should
Have turned to the hearts
Of the ones
That you could not save, oh now
I told you when I found you
All that amounts too
Is love that you fed by
Perversion and pain
